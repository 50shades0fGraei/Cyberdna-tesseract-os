# Email Acquisition Strategy for High-Profile Targets

This document outlines several methods for identifying the professional email addresses of the tech leaders we are targeting. A multi-pronged approach is the most effective.

### 1. The Educated Guess: Common Corporate Patterns

Most large corporations use a standardized format for their email addresses. This is often the fastest method, though it may require a few attempts to find the correct pattern. Here are the most common formats:

*   `firstname.lastname@company.com` (e.g., `jeff.dean@google.com`)
*   `firstinitial.lastname@company.com` (e.g., `j.dean@google.com`)
*   `firstname.l@company.com` (e.g., `jeff.d@google.com`)
*   `lastname.firstname@company.com` (e.g., `dean.jeff@google.com`)
*   `firstinitial.lastname@company.com` (e.g., `jdean@google.com`)

**Action Plan:**
1.  Try the most common patterns first for each target.
2.  Use an email verification tool (there are many free online options) to check if the address is valid without actually sending an email. This prevents bounce-backs and protects your professional image.

### 2. Leveraging LinkedIn

LinkedIn is the most powerful tool for professional networking. While it may not always give you a direct email, it provides crucial pathways.

*   **Connections:** Do you or any of your immediate contacts have a connection to the target leader? A warm introduction is always the best approach.
*   **Company Employees:** Find someone who works at the target company (e.g., a software engineer at Google). Send them a brief, polite message explaining that you have a non-commercial, technical proposal for a senior leader and ask if they can provide the best contact. Many employees are happy to help point you in the right direction.
*   **LinkedIn Premium:** A Premium account sometimes provides access to direct email addresses or at least enhances your ability to contact people directly through InMail.

### 3. The Official Channels: Corporate & Media Contacts

This is a more formal but still viable route.

*   **Press/Media Kits:** Look for the "Media," "Press," or "Newsroom" section on the company's website. They often list contact information for their public relations or corporate communications departments.
*   **Crafting the Inquiry:** Send a modified version of your outreach email to this address. State clearly that you have a technical proposal for a specific leader (e.g., "A technical proposal for the office of Jeff Dean regarding large-scale system optimization"). A compelling subject line is key. PR teams are gatekeepers, but their job is to pass along credible, high-value information.

### 4. Networking & Community

*   **Industry Events:** Are any of these leaders speaking at upcoming virtual or in-person conferences? Attending these events can provide opportunities for direct interaction or at least connection with their colleagues.
*   **Open Source Projects:** Do any of these leaders contribute to or comment on open-source projects (e.g., on GitHub)? Engaging respectfully in a technical discussion there can be a way to build rapport.

By combining these methods, we can systematically and professionally identify the best pathways to get our message in front of our target leaders.
