### Slide 2: The Problem: The Hidden Cost of Complexity (5 Minutes)

*   **Headline:** The Inefficiency of Modern Software
*   **Key Points:**
    *   As software systems grow, so does their complexity.
    *   Traditional code invocation methods create a tangled web of function calls, leading to significant performance bottlenecks.
    *   This results in slower applications, higher infrastructure costs, and a frustrating user experience.
*   **Visual:** A diagram illustrating a complex, tangled network of function calls, labeled "The Old Way."

### Slide 3: The Solution: Introducing the Codemap Tesseract (5 Minutes)

*   **Headline:** A New Dimension in Code Architecture
*   **Key Points:**
    *   The Codemap Tesseract is a revolutionary architecture that pre-maps the relationships between code components.
    *   It creates a multi-dimensional "Tesseract" that allows for a more direct and efficient execution path.
    *   By optimizing the invocation process, we dramatically reduce the number of function calls and CPU overhead.
*   **Visual:** A clean, structured diagram showing a direct, linear flow from one point to another, labeled "The New Way: Codemap Tesseract."

### Slide 4: The Proof: The Data Speaks for Itself (5 Minutes)

*   **Headline:** Conclusive, Data-Driven Evidence
*   **Key Points:**
    *   We conducted a rigorous series of benchmarks, including five 100-iteration runs, to validate our claims.
    *   The results are clear, consistent, and compelling.
*   **Visual:** A prominent bar chart comparing "Traditional Invocation" and "Codemap Tesseract" on two metrics:
    *   **Function Calls:** Showcasing an **~11% reduction**.
    *   **CPU Time:** Highlighting a staggering **~68% reduction**.
