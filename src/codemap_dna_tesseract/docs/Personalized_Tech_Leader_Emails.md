## Microsoft: Kevin Scott & Mark Russinovich

**Subject: A New Architecture for OS and Cloud Efficiency: The Codemap Tesseract**

Dear Mr. Scott and Dr. Russinovich,

I am writing to you today with immense respect for your collective work, from the deep system-level insights of the Sysinternals tools to the forward-looking vision for AI and infrastructure at Microsoft. I have developed a new software architecture that I believe will strongly resonate with your focus on performance and efficiency, both in the operating system and in the cloud.

It’s called the **Codemap Tesseract**. Our benchmarks show it can reduce CPU time by an average of **68%** and function calls by **11%**. We see a direct line from these results to significant efficiency gains within the Windows kernel, the .NET framework, and, of course, the Azure cloud platform.

I am reaching out for your expert feedback, not a financial investment. The potential for the Codemap Tesseract to serve as a foundational enhancement for Microsoft’s core products is, I believe, substantial. The prospect of integrating this architecture to give Azure a definitive performance-per-watt advantage is particularly compelling.

I have attached our R&D report and pitch deck for your review. I would be honored to schedule a brief call to walk you through our findings and discuss the potential applications of this technology to Microsoft’s ecosystem.

Thank you for your time and your contributions to the field.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

## Meta: Mike Schroepfer & Yann LeCun

**Subject: Efficiency in AI and Large-Scale Systems: The Codemap Tesseract**

Dear Mr. Schroepfer and Dr. LeCun,

I am writing to you because of your pioneering work at Meta, from building one of the largest-scale infrastructures in the world to pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence. I have developed a new software architecture that I believe could significantly benefit both of these domains.

It’s called the **Codemap Tesseract**, and it is designed to dramatically improve code execution efficiency. Our benchmarks show an average reduction in CPU time of **68%** and a decrease in function calls by **11%**. For the massive-scale systems that power Meta's platforms, and for the intensive computational loads of training and deploying advanced AI models, the resource savings could be substantial.

My purpose in reaching out is to seek your expert perspective on this technology. The Codemap Tesseract’s ability to streamline code invocation could accelerate AI research and reduce the operational cost of your global infrastructure. We are excited by the possibility of this architecture helping to power the immersive, large-scale simulations of the metaverse.

I have attached our R&D report and pitch deck, and I would be honored to schedule a brief call to demonstrate our findings. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how this might apply to the unique challenges you are solving at Meta.

Thank you for your time and your visionary work.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

## NVIDIA: Jensen Huang

**Subject: Unlocking GPU Potential with a New Software Architecture: The Codemap Tesseract**

Dear Mr. Huang,

I am writing to you as the visionary leader who has positioned NVIDIA at the epicenter of the AI revolution. The power of your hardware is undeniable, and I have developed a new software architecture that I believe can help unlock its full potential.

It’s called the **Codemap Tesseract**, and our validated proof of concept demonstrates that it can reduce CPU time by an average of **68%**. While our tests were CPU-bound, the architectural principle—optimizing the invocation path of code—is directly applicable to the software that orchestrates and feeds data to your GPUs. A more efficient software layer means less waiting and more computing, maximizing the utilization of every CUDA core.

My goal in contacting you is to seek a strategic partnership, not a direct investment. By integrating the Codemap Tesseract architecture into the CUDA software ecosystem, we could create a powerful combination of hardware and software that further solidifies NVIDIA’s dominance in the AI and high-performance computing space.

I have attached our R&D report and pitch deck for your review. I would be honored to schedule a brief call with your technical team to explore this synergy and demonstrate how the Codemap Tesseract can help you sell more, and more powerful, GPUs.

Thank you for your time and for building the engine of the AI revolution.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
